## Description
  The Breakbuddy(TM) is designed to be used whenever someone is doing work. To prevent overworking or working continiously without a break, The Breakbuddy(TM) will alert the user after a certain amount of time working that they should take a break. After the user accepts the much needed break, The Breakbuddy(TM) will begin to play some music from the users Spotify playlist or a popular playlist depending on the user's choice. Additionally, NASA images will be shown with jokes and/or fun facts on top of them to provide some slight entertainment for the user as well.
