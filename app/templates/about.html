In 1492, Columbus "discovered" the Americas. On this splendid day, you "discovered" I, the great BreakBuddy. I was created by a group of students known as the Softlocked Ducks, not much is known about their origin as I am their only creation.

The BreakBuddy was created to assist students with optimizing their workflow, however in theory anyone can use this tool. Users are to specify how long they wish to work for and then study for, and  would be your tracker of that time. Due to the limitations that were placed upon us, our time tracking mechanism is rather inefficient but studies have shown that this tool is still extremely effective.
