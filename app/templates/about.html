In 1492, Columbus "discovered" the Americas. On this splendid day, you "discovered" I, the great BreakBuddy. I was created by a group of students known as the Softlocked Ducks.  Not much is known about their origin as I am their only creation.

The BreakBuddy was created to assist students with optimizing their workflow, however in theory anyone can use this tool. Users are to specify how long they wish to work for and then ignore the Breakbuddy. When they notice the title of the tab changed, they will look back and take a break. Our break system is tailor made to keep the brain stimulated during the break.

    Public peer-reviewed journal Madeup Journal has conducted a study that shows that this tool is highly effective for students of all ages. 
    "Subjects work efficiency increased drastically after utilizing this tool" says Lead Scientist Clearly Fakeperson. Fakeperson and his collegues now personally use this tool for their day to day life and encourage others to do the same.
